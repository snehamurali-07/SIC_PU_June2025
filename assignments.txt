1. Add files in remote repo and in local repo, then sync
2. learn to undo the 3 commands required to push
3. What happens when we have 2 commits and we try to push? Discuss in detail
4. How floating point number is stored in memory?   IEEE standards, which uses a combination of sign, exponent, and mantissa (or significand) to represent the value
5. Find out why there are no ++ and -- operators in python?   Python emphasizes explicit and readable code. While ++i or i++ might be concise, i += 1 or i = i + 1 is considered more explicit and easier to understand
6. Check if year is leap year
7. Check if a +ve integer is Perfect square
8. Find smallest of 3 distinct numbers
9. Farmer Problem
10. Taxation problem.



Check from which of the Python module the following functions come from.
range()
input()
print()
len()
min()
max()
sorted()
---Built-in functions in Python, meaning they are available without needing to import any specific module.

5. Find the Nth Fibo (HemaChandra) term. Assume 1st 2 terms are 1 and 2
6. Find sum of the series n - n2/3 + n4/5 - n8/7 .... m terms (1<=n<=4 and 2<=m<=10)
7. Print the following shapes by accepting number of lines

B. Equilateral Triangle
C. Hollow Square
D. Hallow Rhombus
E. Pascal's Triangle

8. Find sum of the Even placed digits in the given number.
9. Find sum of the Odd placed Even digits in the given number.

IMPORTANT SOURCES OF LEARNING:
1. Official Documentation (java: oracle docs, Front-End: Dev.mozilla, PythonL Python docs, C/C++: MSDN or IBM)
2. YouTube: MIT Open University, Stanford
3. Certification: NPTEL, Company Certification (AWS, GCP, Java-1Z0830, PythonInstitute.org PCAP, PCEP, PCED)
CDAC is the best
--------------------
1. Which modules(s) are automatically loaded/imported by python interpreter  builtins(print, len, int) and sys
2. In which module does print(), input(), len() functions come from?  built-in functions




Solid principles
Design principles
learn methods of strings and list
why command line arguments are stored in list and why not in tuple?

python p2.py "states capital"

states = []
capital = []
STATE     CAPITAL
